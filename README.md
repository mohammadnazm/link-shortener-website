# Link Shortener Website

A link shortener website is a web-based tool designed to create shortened and more manageable URLs from long, complex ones. The primary purpose of a link shortener is to make sharing links easier, especially on platforms with character limitations like social media, messaging apps, and emails. Instead of sharing lengthy URLs, users can use the link shortener to generate compact and user-friendly links that redirect to the original, longer URL when clicked.
